    The Climate Synapse project is a platform which connects investors with early-stage entrepreneurs on climate related projects. 
    The idea is simple though challenging: connecting all these people, so that we can be more efficient in how we bring resources to bear on global warming?
    By creating greater visibility into technological innovation using new tools, we will see whoâ€™s doing what in technology areas that are critical to address the climate crisis. 
    We hope to accelerate innovation and integration of new technologies into the economy. 
    We used powerful tools of data analysis and machine learning to interrogate data thatâ€™s available, including published scientific research and patent databases.
